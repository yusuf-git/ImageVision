# ImageVision
This is a framework built in TypeScript to serve the purpose of writing powerful automated tests leveraging Computer Vision solutions 
built with python. The pythonic CV solution lies at the backend. The TDK or test development kit associated with this package provides 
the user with a programming interface to develop E2E tests primarily against those applications that are largely characterized by complex 
visual aspects of the advanced business use cases

Note : To setup local devtest Env. pls download miniconda from the Conda portal : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html. Refer to my ImageBench repository for further information
